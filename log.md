# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 24, 2022 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Started the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022. Finished the first section, ultimately ending up with a band name generator.

**Thoughts:** Some of this I had already known from starting a separate python course, but I did learn about embedding the input function in a print function. print("Hello " + input("What is your name?")".") Side note: I wish my band name would have been cooler than Lancaster Mika or Lancaster Benson.

### Day 2: April 26, 2022 
##### 

**NOTE: I did code yesterday, but mistakenly did not update my log. I did create a blog over at medium and you can find yesterday's post there. [keaton palmer medium](https://keatonpalmer.medium.com/)

**Today's Progress**: Created a tiny text based adventure, love calculator, and leap year calculator.

**Thoughts:** Today was a lot of if/else statements and some logical operators. I loved the idea of the text based adventure and would love to try making a somewhat more serious one some day!
