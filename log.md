# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 24, 2022 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Started the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022. Finished the first section, ultimately ending up with a band name generator.

**Thoughts:** Some of this I had already known from starting a separate python course, but I did learn about embedding the input function in a print function. print("Hello " + input("What is your name?")".") Side note: I wish my band name would have been cooler than Lancaster Mika or Lancaster Benson.
